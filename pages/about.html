                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>I grew up in Ethiopia, where my passion for math and science blossomed early in my childhood. As I grew, my love for solving math problems evolved into a broader interest in problem-solving, particularly in computer science algorithms that demand critical thinking, much like mathematics.</p>
                    
                    <p>Professionally, I am focused on building my skills as a software engineer. I began my journey as a Software Engineering student at Addis Ababa Institute of Technology for about three years before moving to the US. This experience laid a strong foundation in computer science and allowed me to work with various programming languages, including Python, Java, Go, PostgreSQL, .NET, HTML, CSS, C, C#, and more.</p>
                    
                    <p>Afterward, I earned my Associate of Science in Computer Science from Saint Paul College in Minnesota, where I had the opportunity to learn from experienced professors working in the industry, as well as explore additional programming languages like OCaml. During this time, I worked as a Software Engineer Intern at Nagios Enterprises LLC, which provided me with hands-on experience in enterprise-level software development and real-world problem-solving.</p>
                    
                    <p>Currently, I am completing my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at Metropolitan State University, Saint Paul. As a junior, I also worked as a Wafer Fab Operator at Polar Semiconductor LLC, where I gained insight into the processes behind the chips that power our smart systems.</p>
                    
                    <p>I am now preparing for my next big leap! I am looking for a career that is both rewarding and challenging, one that will help me grow as a person and as a software engineer.</p>
