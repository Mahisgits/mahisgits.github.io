                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I grew up in Ethiopia, where my passion for maths and science blossomed early on my chiildhood. AS I grew up the love for maths problem solving, changed to all sorts of problem solving and
                    most of all Computer Science algorithms as it required lots of critical thinking as maths required.
                </p>
                <p>Professionally, I am focused on building my skills as a software engineer. As I was a Software Engineering student back home in ADdis Ababa Institute of Technology for 
                    aboout 3 years which is untill I moved to US, I got to byild strong foundation in computer science, also an opportunity to work on different programming languages, including python, java,
                    Go, postgreSQL, postnet, java, HTML, CSS, C , C# and so on. </p>
                    <p>After that, I graduated my Associate of Science  in Computer Science from Saint Paul College here in Minnesota, having a chance to work with great professors who 
                        work in the industry, and addiitional programming languages like Ocaml. While going to college, I had a previlidge to work in Nagios Enterprises LLC, SAint Paul MN, 
                    to  work as a Software Engineer Intern, which helped me notonly work on enterprise level languages, but also an opportuinity to enter in to real world technology problem solving</p>
                    <p>Then, my passion for technology continued and I now is about to graduate my BAchelor of Science from Metro STate University, Saint Paul majoring in Computer Sceince.
                        While I was a junior in my current University, I also got an opportunity to work as a wafer fab operator in Polar Semiconductor LLC,  which allowed me see the process that our smart systems
                        incorporated- chips!
                    </p>
                    <p>Now getting ready for my next big leap! Looking for a career that is rewarding and challenging enough to help me grow stronger as a person, and as a software Engineer!
